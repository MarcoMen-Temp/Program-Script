### Weekly Assignments


#### Week 1 - fib.py (by Dr. Ian Mcloughlin )

  > Task - Was to copy and paste a file from GitHub and run it in VS Code
  > File - returns the nth Fibonnaci number, which in fib.py is 28 and returns the 28th fibonnacci number( 317811 )


----------------------------------------------------------//----------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Week2 - 

> File Used This Week - Same for both assignments
   * fib1-week2.py - 
      * In this file I input my first name in an assigned variable
      * The file then runs and assigns the ASCII character codes for the first and last letters 
      * Calculates the sum
      * Returns the nth(=Sum calculated) fibonnaci number
  
  * week2-fib2.py -
      * This is the same as above,but for the surname is used in the variable input( I used my second name )
      
      
----------------------------------------------------------//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
           
#### Week 3 - week3.py

File - Returns the Collatz Sequence
> Collatz Sequence :
> A random number runs a backwards sequence and ends always in 1
   > Two Conditions For This to happen:
* If an odd nunmber --> divide by 3 and add 1
* If even number --> divide by 2

I also included the number of steps(counted) that it took for the sequence to run until it reaches 1 

According to "Numberphile" on YouTube, the highest number(the one that takes the highest number of steps to reach to 1) is 63,728,127( 949 steps to reach to 1 )

#### Week 4 - <Project Euler -Prob5> Problem5.py (Not uploaded yet)




---------------------------------------------------------//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Week 5 - <DataSet> format.py
  > This is a folder that contains open.py(which is the one performed by Lecturer on video lecture)
  
  > The format.py is the file for the assignment,with top row,numerical values formatted(column spaced and aligned with the top) and separator('|')
  
  
  -------------------------------------------------------//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
#### Week 6 - factorials.py


> Factorial of a number is number multiplication sequence,that starts from the number and multiplies by all the previous numbers down to 1.
   > Example:
   
   * 5! = 5x4x3x2x1
   * But 0! = 1(not 0)
   
> This algorithm can be written using recursion(a function that returns to itself until the condition is no longer satisfied-exiting the function)
