### Weekly Assignments


#### Week 1 - fib.py (by Dr. Ian Mcloughlin )

  > Task - Was to copy and paste a file from GitHub and run it in VS Code
  > File - returns the nth Fibonnaci number, which in fib.py is 28 and returns the 28th fibonnacci number( 317811 )




#### Week2 - 

> File Used This Week - Same for both assignments
   * fib1-week2.py - 
   **In this file I input my first name,
   **the file then runs and assigns the ASCII character codes for the first and last letters 
   ** Calculates the sum
   **Returns the nth(=Sum calculated) fibonnaci number
  
  * week2-fib2.py -
  ** This is the same as above,but for the surname( I used my second name )
           
           
#### Week 3 - week3.py

File - Returns the Collatz Sequence
> Collatz Sequence :
>> A random number runs a backwards sequence and ends always in 1
Two Conditions For This to happen:
* If an odd nunmber --> divide by 3 and add 1
* If even number --> divide by 2

I also included the number of steps(counted) that it took for the sequence to run until it reaches 1 

According to "Numberphile" on YouTube, the highest number(the one that takes the highest number of steps to reach to 1) is 63,728,127( 949 steps to reach to 1 )

#### Week 5 - <DataSet> format.py
  > This is a folder that contains open.py(which is the one
